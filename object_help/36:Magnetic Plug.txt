The Magnetic Plug is an object that can attract Magnetic Sockets. When two magnetic objects are connected, the plug can transfer signals to the socket.

If the plug is not connected to a socket, the <b><tt>IN0</tt></b> signal will be sent to the alternative output, <b><tt>OUT1</tt></b>.

<b><big>Socket information:</big></b>
<b><tt>IN0</tt></b>: Input signal
<b><tt>OUT0</tt></b>: Status (is plug connected to socket?)
<b><tt>OUT1</tt></b>: Alternative output
