The Magnetic Plug is an object that can attract Magnetic Sockets. When two magnetic objects are connected, the plug can transfer signals to the socket.

If the plug is not connected to a socket, the IN0 signal will be sent to the alternative output, <b><tt>OUT1</tt></b>.

<b><tt>IN0</tt></b>: Input signal
<b><tt>OUT0</tt></b>: Status (is plug connected to socket?)
<b><tt>OUT1</tt></b>: Alternative output
