Identical to Moving Average, but resets itself if an input signal of exactly 0 is received:

<span font_family="monospace">
I: = / x > 0 : xa + I(1-a)
     \ x = 0 : 0
</span>

Where <span font_family="monospace">x</span> is the input signal, <span font_family="monospace">I</span> is the internal value and <span font_family="monospace">a</span> is a weight factor.
