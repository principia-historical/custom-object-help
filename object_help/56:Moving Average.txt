Output a value according to:

<span font_family="monospace" background="white">I := xa + I(1-a)</span>

Where <span font_family="monospace" background="white">x</span> is the input signal, <span font_family="monospace" background="white">I</span> is the internal value and <span font_family="monospace" background="white">a</span> is a weight factor.

<span font_family="monospace" background="white">I</span> is always initially 0.

Example usage:
Connect a Moving Average component to a Floor component, the input value of the system will "charge" for some time depending on the Moving Average's weight factor, before a 1 is output.
