A miniature version of the Transmitter, that is only able to transmit signals over a single frequency.

Multiple transmitters can be used on the same frequency, the one sending a non-zero value will take precedent over the others. If multiple transmitters are transmitting non-zero values at the same time, which value is actually transmitted is undefined.
