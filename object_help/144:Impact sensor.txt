When an impact occurs, for example an object collided with the sensor, a value is sent through <b><tt>OUT0</tt></b>.

Use the Threshold slider to set the maximum impact value. This will be the value corresponding to 1.0 through <b><tt>OUT0</tt></b>.

<b><tt>OUT0</tt></b>: Impact value between 0.0 and 1.0
