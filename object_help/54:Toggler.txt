Whenever a bit of 1 is read from <b><tt>IN0</tt></b>, the output stream is toggled.

<b>Example:</b>
<span font_family="monospace">0001001000010</span> -> <span font_family="monospace">0001110000011</span>

Use in combination with the sparsifier and the effect on control panel buttons is a "checkbox" that can be toggled on/off.
