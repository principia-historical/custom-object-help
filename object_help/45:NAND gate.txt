Same as the AND gate, but the output value is inverted.

Advanced help:
Binary device. Given two inputs, <b><tt>IN0</tt></b> and <b><tt>IN1</tt></b>, <b><tt>OUT0</tt></b> will output 1 if at most one of <b><tt>IN0</tt></b> and <b><tt>IN1</tt></b> are 1. Since this is a binary device, the input value is rounded so any value above 0.5 is equal to 1.
<b><tt>IN0</tt></b>: Value A
<b><tt>IN1</tt></b>: Value B
<b><tt>OUT0</tt></b>: A NAND B
