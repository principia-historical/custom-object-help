Broadcast a signal over a range of frequencies.

If a value other than 0 is receiver through <b><tt>IN1</tt></b>, the frequency range is shifted by +<b><tt>IN1</tt></b>*10 rounded to the nearest whole value.

If multiple broadcasters broadcast over the same frequencies, what value a receiver would pick up is undefined. A transmitter transmitting on a frequency in a broadcasters frequency range will override the broadcast value.

<b><tt>IN0</tt></b>: The signal to broadcast.
<b><tt>IN1</tt></b>: Frequency shift.
