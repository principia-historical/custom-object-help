Adventure robots can connect to the backpack by walking close to it and clicking on it.

In earlier versions (pre-1.5) the Backpack was required to make the robot able to interact with RCs. This is no longer the case, but despite that it's still a pretty useful object. For instance, it can be utilized to make the robot able to push and pull objects using the backpack.
