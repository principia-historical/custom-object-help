Adventure robots can connect to the backpack by walking close to it and clicking on it. If the backpack is connected directly to a control panel (RC Micro, RC Basic, RC IO-3 or RC Monstro), the on-screen widgets will be swapped out for those of the control panel. This allows the player to control something other than the robot in adventure mode.
