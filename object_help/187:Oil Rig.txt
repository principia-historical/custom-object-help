An oil rig to be used by the adventure robot. Connect the bottom of the oil rig to terrain and the rig will start pumping oil. When the oil rig is full, it emits a barrel of oil. When the ground below is out of oil, the right lamp will start blinking, and you have to move the oil rig to another place.

Take the emitted barrel of oil to a Factory to be able to construct objects requiring oil.

Oil is used to create all plastic objects.
